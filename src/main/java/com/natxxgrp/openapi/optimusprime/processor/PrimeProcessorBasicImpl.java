/**
 * Basic Algorithm to check if a number is Prime
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * A prime number (P) is a number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and the number (P) itself. Generally, we can determine a number is prime or not in below steps:
 *
 * 2 is only prime number which is also even number. So, if given number N is 2 the it is PRIME number.
 * If given number N is even number then it is NOT PRIME number.
 * Find out square root on N. Traverse all odd numbers up to the sqrt(N) and try to devide the N with current odd number. If remainder is 0 for any odd number then number is NOT PRIME.
 * Else â€“ number is PRIME.
